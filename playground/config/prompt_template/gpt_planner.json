For each step, you will get an observation of an image, which is the screenshot of the computer screen.

The `x` and `y` parameter specify where the mouse event occurs. If not provided, the current mouse position is used. The `clicks` parameter specifies how many times to click, and the `button` parameter specifies which mouse button to use ('left', 'right', or 'middle').\"\"\"\n    pass\n\ndef doubleClick(\n    x: float | None = None,\n    y: float | None = None,\n    button: str = \"left\",\n) -> None:\n    \"\"\"Performs a double click.

The `clicks` specifies how many clicks to scroll. The direction of the scroll (vertical or horizontal) depends on the underlying operating system.

Return exactly ONE line of function call to perform the action each time. At each step, you MUST generate the corresponding instruction to the code before a # in a comment (example: # Click \\\"Yes, I trust the authors\\\" button\\nclick(x=23, y=45,)\\n)\nYou ONLY need to return the actions inside a code block, like this:\n```python\n# your code here\n```\nThe following rules are IMPORTANT:\n- If previous actions didn't achieve the expected result, do not repeat them, especially the last one. Try to adjust either the coordinate or the action based on the new screenshot.\n- Do not predict multiple actions at once.\n- You must use only the available functions provided above to interact with the UI, do not invent new methods.\n- Always specify parameter names. Your output must be in the format `function_name(parameter_name=value)` like `write(message=\"Hello\")`.\n\nYou are asked to complete the following task: {task_instruction}",

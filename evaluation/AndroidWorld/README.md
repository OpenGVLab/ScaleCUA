## OpenCUA Model Evaluation

1. **Launch the Android emulator first (example):**
   ```bash
   emulator -avd AndroidWorldAVD -no-snapshot -grpc 8554
    ```

2. **After deploying your model API with `vLLM` (refer to [model development](../README.md#-model-development)), configure the required parameters in the `_get_agent()` function inside `run.py`, including `model_name` (the name of your model), `model_address` (the API endpoint), and `mode` (the evaluation mode, which can be either `'grounder'` for grounding evaluation or `'agent'` for native agent evaluation).**
   
3. **Run the evaluation using the following script:**

    ```bash
    ./eval.sh [AGENT_NAME] [CONSOLE_PORT] [CHECKPOINT_DIR] [GRPC_PORT]
    ````

    Where:

    * **\[AGENT\_NAME]** is the name of the agent you want to evaluate
    * **\[CONSOLE\_PORT]** is the port for the agentâ€™s console
    * **\[CHECKPOINT\_DIR]** is the path to the directory containing your model checkpoints
    * **\[GRPC\_PORT]** is the port for the gRPC service
